<p align="center"><strong>Bulk removing github repositories made easy üóëÔ∏è</strong></p>

<br/>


<br/>

## Motivation

The main motive behind this app is that the manual way of deleting a repo is quite tedious. And if you want to bulk delete redundant/old/fork repos then it can be a frustrating process. There are other alternatives like scripts that does the same thing. But I prefer a UI while selecting what to delete because it is much more clear and just to be sure that you are not accidentally deleting any important stuff.

## Features

- Minimal user interface and easy to use
- Github authorization over token-based approach
